## Project 01:
### About Project
#### 1. This project is based on image classification in which model is able to predict 3 classes i.e, Early_Blight disease , Late_Blight disease and Healthy. Actually the purpose of this model is to help the farmers. Potatos plants have 2 diseases which can be caused by different reasons. These diseases are early blight and late blight. So this model is trained on 3 classes that whether plants are healthy or having early_blight disease or late_blight disease. So that farmers treat the diseased plants well.
#### 2. Then, I use ‚ñ∂Ô∏èstreamlit web interface so that through best GUI we will able to predict model results in better way.
