## Project 01:
### <b>About Project</b>
#### <b>1. </b>This project is based on <b>image classification</b> in which model is able to predict <b>3 classes i.e, Early_Blight disease , Late_Blight disease and Healthy</b>. Actually the purpose of this model is to <b>help the farmers</b>. Potatos plants have 2 diseases which can be caused by different reasons. These diseases are early blight and late blight. So this model is trained on 3 classes that whether plants are healthy or having early_blight disease or late_blight disease. So that farmers treat the diseased plants well.
#### 
#### <b>2. </b>Then, I use ‚ñ∂Ô∏è<b>streamlit</b> web interface so that through best GUI we will able to predict model results in better way.
